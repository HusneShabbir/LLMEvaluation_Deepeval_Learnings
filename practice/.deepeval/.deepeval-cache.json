{"test_cases_lookup_map": {"{\"actual_output\": \" To create a new deployment in OpenShift for a containerized application, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Create a Project:**\\n   First, you need to create a project (also known as a namespace) where your application will reside. You can do this by running the following command:\\n\\n   ```\\n   oc new-project <your-project-name>\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Build or Pull an Image:**\\n   Before deploying your application, you need to have a container image. This can be built locally using tools like Docker and then pushed to a registry like Red Hat's OpenShift Container Registry (OCR), Docker Hub, or Google Container Registry. Alternatively, you can pull an existing image from a registry.\\n\\n   For example, if you have an image in Docker Hub named `myimage:latest`, you can import it to OCR with the following command:\\n\\n   ```\\n   oc import-image myimage:latest --from=docker\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Create a Deployment Configuration:**\\n   Next, create a Deployment Configuration (DC) that describes how your application should be deployed and managed. This can be done using a YAML file. Here's an example of what such a file might look like:\\n\\n   ```yaml\\n   apiVersion: apps/v1\\n   kind: Deployment\\n   metadata:\\n     name: <your-deployment-name>\\n   spec:\\n     replicas: 3\\n     selector:\\n       matchLabels:\\n         app: <your-app-name>\\n     template:\\n       metadata:\\n         labels:\\n           app: <your-app-name>\\n       spec:\\n         containers:\\n         - name: <your-container-name>\\n           image: <image-registry>/<your-image>:<tag>\\n           ports:\\n           - containerPort: 8080\\n   ```\\n\\n   Replace the placeholders with appropriate names and values for your application. Save this file, let's say as `mydeployment.yaml`.\\n\\n4. **Create Deployment:**\\n   Now you can create the deployment using the YAML file:\\n\\n   ```\\n   oc create -f mydeployment.yaml\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Verify Deployment:**\\n   To check if the deployment is successful, use the following command:\\n\\n   ```\\n   oc get deployments\\n   ```\\n\\n6. **Expose the Deployment as a Service:**\\n   If you want to expose your application outside of OpenShift, you can create a Service that acts as an entry point. Here's an example of what such a Service configuration might look like:\\n\\n   ```yaml\\n   apiVersion: v1\\n   kind: Service\\n   metadata:\\n     name: <your-service-name>\\n   spec:\\n     selector:\\n       app: <your-app-name>\\n     ports:\\n     - port: 80\\n       targetPort: 8080\\n       protocol: TCP\\n     type: ClusterIP\\n   ```\\n\\n   Save this file, let's say as `myservice.yaml`. Then create the Service:\\n\\n   ```\\n   oc create -f myservice.yaml\\n   ```\\n\\n7. **Accessing the Application:**\\n   If you created a Service and set its type to `ClusterIP`, you can access your application within OpenShift by using the service's name as hostname, like this:\\n\\n   ```\\n   curl <your-service-name>.<project-namespace>.svc.cluster.local\\n   ```\\n\\n   If you exposed the Service to the internet (by setting its type to `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`), you can access your application using the corresponding IP and port.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Who is the current president of the India?\", \"retrieval_context\": null}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Answer Relevancy", "threshold": 0.5, "success": false, "score": 0.0, "reason": "The score is 0.0 because all statements in the actual output are irrelevant and do not address the question about the Indian president at all.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "deepseek-r1:8b (Ollama)", "evaluationCost": 0.0, "verboseLogs": "Statements:\n[\n    \"To create a new deployment in OpenShift for a containerized application, follow these steps.\",\n    \"First, you need to create a project (also known as a namespace) where your application will reside.

It provides a way to automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications within Red Hat OpenShift.\\n\\n### Key Concepts\\n1. **Pipeline**: A series of steps (tasks) executed in order to achieve a specific goal, such as building, testing, and deploying an application.\\n2. **Task**: An individual step in a pipeline that performs a specific action, like compiling code or running tests.\\n3. **Trigger**: An event that initiates the execution of a pipeline, such as a Git commit or a scheduled job.\\n4. **Condition**: Logic to control whether subsequent tasks should run based on certain criteria (e.g., only proceed if previous tests pass).\\n5. **Parameter**: Variables that can be set at runtime to customize pipeline behavior.\\n6. **Resource**: Represents a piece of infrastructure, like a Kubernetes pod or service, which tasks may use.\\n\\n### Basic Workflow Example\\nLet's outline a simple OpenShift Pipeline for deploying a web application:\\n\\n1. **Trigger**: A new commit is pushed to the main branch of your Git repository.\\n2. **Pipeline Execution**:\\n   - **Task 1 (Build)**: Compiles source code and packages it into a container image using tools like `docker build`.\\n     ```yaml\\n     - name: build\\n       taskRef:\\n         name: docker-build\\n       resources:\\n         inputs:\\n           - name: source\\n             resource: source-code\\n     ```\\n   - **Task 2 (Test)**: Runs unit tests on the built application.\\n     ```yaml\\n     - name: test\\n       taskRef:\\n         name: run-tests\\n       resources:\\n         inputs:\\n           - name: image\\n             resource: build-image\\n     ```\\n   - **Condition**: Only proceed if tests pass.\\n     ```yaml\\n     - name: condition-check\\n       condition: eq(tasks.test.status, 'success')\\n     ```\\n   - **Task 3 (Deploy)**: Deploys the application to OpenShift using `oc apply`.\\n     ```yaml\\n     - name: deploy\\n       taskRef:\\n         name: openshift-deploy\\n       resources:\\n         inputs:\\n           - name: image\\n             resource: test-image\\n     ```\\n\\n### Getting Started with OpenShift Pipelines\\n1. **Install Tekton CLI**: Use the official [Tekton installation guide](https://tekton.dev/guides/install/) to set up the Tekton CLI on your local machine or within your CI environment.\\n2. **Create Pipeline Resources**: Define your pipelines using YAML files, similar to the example above.\\n3. **Use OpenShift Web Console**: Navigate to the Pipelines section in the OpenShift web console to create and manage pipelines visually.\\n4. **Integrate with Git Repositories**: Configure triggers to start pipelines automatically on specific events (e.g., push to a branch).\\n\\n### Additional Resources\\n- [OpenShift Documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cicd/pipelines/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html)\\n- [Tekton Pipelines Guide](https://tekton.dev/guides/)\\n\\nBy understanding these concepts and following the basic workflow, you can start building and managing CI/CD pipelines on OpenShift effectively.

**Replicas**: Set the number of pod replicas you want running.\\n\\n5. **Configure Deployment Strategy:**\\n   - Choose a deployment strategy:\\n     - **Rolling Update**: Recommended for most scenarios, it updates pods incrementally to minimize downtime.\\n     - **Recreate**: Replaces existing pods with new ones, causing brief downtime.\\n\\n6. **Service Configuration (Optional):**\\n   - If you want your application to be accessible via a service:\\n     - Check the box \\\"Create a new service\\\".\\n     - Select the type of service (e.g., `ClusterIP`, `NodePort`, or `LoadBalancer`).\\n     - Configure the service details as needed.\\n\\n7. **Review and Create:**\\n   - Review all settings to ensure they match your requirements.\\n   - Click \\\"Create\\\" to start the deployment process.\\n\\n8. **Monitor Deployment Status:**\\n   - Once created, you can monitor the status of your deployment in the \\\"Topology\\\" view or under \\\"Workloads > Deployments\\\".\\n\\n### Using `oc` (OpenShift CLI):\\n\\n1. **Log in to OpenShift using `oc`:**\\n   ```bash\\n   oc login <your-cluster-url> --token=<your-token>\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Create a New Project (if needed):**\\n   ```bash\\n   oc new-project my-app-project\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Create a Deployment Configuration File (`my-app-deployment.yaml`):**\\n   ```yaml\\n   apiVersion: apps/v1\\n   kind: Deployment\\n   metadata:\\n     name: my-app-deployment\\n   spec:\\n     replicas: 3\\n     selector:\\n       matchLabels:\\n         app: my-app\\n     template:\\n       metadata:\\n         labels:\\n           app: my-app\\n       spec:\\n         containers:\\n         -
